# Azure Function using OpenAI trigger and bindings extension to highlight OpenAI function calling

This sample highlights how to use the OpenAI trigger and bindings extension in an Azure Function to call custom functions using OpenAI.

You can learn more about the OpenAI trigger and bindings extension in the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-openai-extension) and in the [Official OpenAI extension documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-bindings-openai)




## Prerequisites

* [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or greater (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)
* [Azure Functions Core Tools v4.x](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cwindows%2Cnode%2Cportal%2Cbash)
* [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openai/overview)

## Prepare your local environment

### Create local.settings.json (should be in the same folder as host.json)
```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet-isolated",
    "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "https://<openairesource>.openai.azure.com/",
    "CHAT_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME": "gpt-4"
    }
}
```

### Permissions
#### Add the following permissions to the Azure OpenAI resource:
<b>Cognitive Services OpenAI User</b> - Add your account (contoso.microsoft.com) to the OpenAI resource to test locally and the Azure Function App's Managed Identity in Azure. You can enable managed identity from the Identity page in the Azure Functions app.

## Run your app using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the folder in a new terminal.
1. Run the `code .` code command to open the project in Visual Studio Code.
1. In the command palette (F1), type `Azurite: Start`, which enables debugging without warnings.
1. Press **Run/Debug (F5)** to run in the debugger. Select **Debug anyway** if prompted about local emulator not running.
1. Send GET and POST requests to the `httpget` and `httppost` endpoints respectively using your HTTP test tool (or browser for `httpget`). If you have the [RestClient](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension installed, you can execute requests directly from the [`test.http`](./http/test.http) project file.

## Run your app using Visual Studio

1. Open the `http.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.
1. Press **Run/F5** to run in the debugger. Make a note of the `localhost` URL endpoints, including the port, which might not be `7071`.
1. Open the [`test.http`](./http/test.http) project file, update the port on the `localhost` URL (if needed), and then use the built-in HTTP client to call the `httpget` and `httppost` endpoints.


## Deploy to Azure

Run this command to provision the function app, with any required Azure resources, and deploy your code:

```shell
azd up
```

You're prompted to supply these required deployment parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| _Environment name_ | An environment that's used to maintain a unique deployment context for your app. You won't be prompted if you created the local project using `azd init`.|
| _Azure subscription_ | Subscription in which your resources are created.|
| _Azure location_ | Azure region in which to create the resource group that contains the new Azure resources. Only regions that currently support the Flex Consumption plan are shown.|

After publish completes successfully, `azd` provides you with the URL endpoints of your new functions, but without the function key values required to access the endpoints. To learn how to obtain these same endpoints along with the required function keys, see [Invoke the function on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-azure-developer-cli?pivots=programming-language-dotnet#invoke-the-function-on-azure) in the companion article [Quickstart: Create and deploy functions to Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-azure-developer-cli?pivots=programming-language-dotnet).

## Redeploy your code

You can run the `azd up` command as many times as you need to both provision your Azure resources and deploy code updates to your function app.

>[!NOTE]
>Deployed code files are always overwritten by the latest deployment package.

## Clean up resources

When you're done working with your function app and related resources, you can use this command to delete the function app and its related resources from Azure and avoid incurring any further costs:

```shell
azd down
```
